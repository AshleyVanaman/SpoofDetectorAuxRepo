# User Manual 

The intended user for this program would likely have a technical background, but even so, this program should be easy for a user to navigate and access the available features.

## Step 4
In the top left corner of the screen, the user can see two buttons, "Clean" and "Refresh". 
"Clean" will show only the valid/filtered data points. When "Clean" is toggled off, the user will be able to see filtered and unfiltered data points at the same point.
"Refresh" will update the web page with the information from the server, using the 'cleaned' data from data_processor.py.

## Step 5
The first time a user clicks refresh, the web page updates and populates the map with drones from a test server.
The user can click on a specific drone to see the unique ID, latitude, longitude, altitude, and rating listed in the top corner.

## Step 6
While having the drone selected, the user can click on the camera button in the top right to see a point of view that is not solely from space.
The user can also use the middle-mouse button to move the camera as they please.
