- From here, click on 'Go to Map' to view the topographic map

## Step 2
- Now you can see drones on a topographic map with a drone path that it has taken through the air. As well, operator location is displayed with a red dot on the ground to signify where the person is flying the drone from

- "Reset" resets the camera back to the position of the first drone in the dataset
- "Toggle Clean" will toggle between showing both "clean and dirty" data or only "clean" data
- "Previous Drone" moves the camera to the previous drone in the dataset
- "Next Drone" moves the camera to the next drone in the dataset

## Step 5

- Try zooming out and looking at the drones move through the flight paths from a distance!
