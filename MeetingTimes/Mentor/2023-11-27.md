## Topics Discussed
- Talked about our current progress on the project.
 - Got Cesium map to work, need to adjust json output for height so we can map flight path.
 - Some code has been refactored into chunks.
- Mentioned our Second iteration features to the mentor.
 - Determine what data is 'clean' and add related flags to data points.
 - Go from a text-based user interface to a GUI.
 - Create a webpage with a user sign in system to display the application.
- Discussed feedback given regarding Iteration 1.
- Mentioned to the client that we have more access to real data and we now have access to SquidRID data that we will be able to test our code with now.

## Topics Clarified
- Went into depth on our current code progress and what we have currently and plan to do for the remainder of the iteration. Modularization and breaking code into chunks so we can do testing and getting the map function to work in our code and track flight paths.

 ## Iteration Feedback
- Glad we have a plan on how we hope to proceed in regards to the code.
- Mentor believes the second iteration features sound good.
- Recommended we put in more work; set up a meeting with the mentor for later on in the week with more progress.
