## Topics Discussed

  - Added more config variables to drone and fixed data retriever, so ue can get the data from the test server
  - Told Nate the new structure, how the python would be hosted on the server and unreal would pull from that
- Discussed how VS community isn't including required files for building the project
- Discussed how we might want to change certain classes from c++ to blueprints for UE ease of access

## Things Clarified
- Offered to help with troubleshooting for VS commuinity and building projects
- Offered to help guide us through converting a c++ class to a blueprint class in UE

 ## Mid-Iteration Feedback
- Nate said he liked that we wouldn't have to reimplement everything from the python code
- Nate was hopeful we would get more features added, but was skeptical of current progress
  - Suggested shifting to add functionality to the web page if we can't get the unreal engine up to par by this weekend
- Nate was concerned we hadn't started any testing of unreal engine components
- Overall, Nate was pretty concerned with our lack of overall progress on unreal engine
  - Cited working in a new game engine is especially difficult
  - Said company can always take what we've worked on now and change it later for their benefit
