CLIENT USE OF THE PROJECT

How did the client use the software?
We did a demonstration for him on the web browser rather than runnning it himself.

What features did they test in your software?
He wanted to see that he could find the operator and that the path from the drone was still there after a couple minutes.

How long did they use your software?
He wanted to watch for about three minutes so that he could see more of the flight simulated.

How was their reaction to the software?
He was positive about it and liked the progress

Did you recognize anything unusual/different/good/bad?
The drone flight was a little bit buggy, so we were able to fix that shortly thereafter.

Issues (any usability, functionality, etc issues)
We talked a little bit about unreal engine and some of the problems relating to us making progress on it. 
We have a lot of work done on those scripts, but 

AFTER MEETING
Meeting start time: 12:30PM
Meeting end time: 1:30PM
Location/medium: Over Zoom
Present: Sam Gross, Logan Parker, Chris
Minute recorder: Sam
Topics discussed: We discussed what was most useful in the iteration 4 features so that we could carry that into iteration 5.
Things clarified: We clarified that iteration five would use unreal engine for front and backend code, which means that we need to translate our current project into C++. This was a big change, and bit frustrating that we cannot use our python files, but it is definitely what the client wants and the operation speed, usability, and graphics will be drastically improved.
