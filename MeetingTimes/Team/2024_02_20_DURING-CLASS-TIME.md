    Visual Studio 2022 x64 must be installed in order to build this target."
- Added C+/C++ extension, C# entension, C# Dev Kit, and .NET Install Tool to VS Code on desktop computers.

### Progress Made
- Attempted to set up lab computers for unreal engine; we realized some members in the group do not have a laptop that can handle running Unreal Engine or that barely meet the minimum requirements.
  -  We realized we needed an admin username and password to download or update anything on the computers to allow access to our project. Davis came into the capstone room after we stated what would need to be downloaded for us to run the project on the computers. He has begun to give us permissions so we can use the computers to run our project.
- Even though we couldn't access the project on the desktop computers, we worked on familiarizing ourselves with unreal. We did this by making empty projects so we can get used to moving around in the software as well as placing things.
- Worked on test classes for our project when not attempting updates or familiarizing with unreal.
