### Topics Clarified
- Worked on merging our branches so our code, files, and branches are more organized.
- Talked about inputting a completeness score.
- Separate our squidRID; We are going to input the new, more detailed data, chris has given us into our project resource file.
- Check if speed is before 0 and 44 ms/sec; if it is = full points. If 44 - 100 m/s = flag for breaking guidelines. 100+ and below 0 m/s = flag for odd data.
  - Speed is based on the current specification of max drone speed being 44 m/s.
- Check if -1000, 12, or 24. 24 is normal, 12 is weird, -1000 is strange
- Added in functions: evaluateSpeed, evaluateAreaFloorAndCeiling, evaluateTrackDirection and tests.

### Progress Made
- Branches have been merged and more clean coding has been done to ensure the code is easier to read and understand. We ran into some merging conflicts which took a bit of time to fix. Distributed tasks among members and they are listed below.
- Sam is working on HTML and getting cesium to work.
- Michaela Evaluating Speed function and test
- Ashley Tracking Direction function and test
- Leah working on getting the new file to convert into our software
- Logan working on modularizing breaking code into separate files: index, css, javascript, html files.
