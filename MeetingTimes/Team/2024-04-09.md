### Topics Discussed
- We discussed how we could potentially speed up our project to avoid the lag that we are currently experiencing.
  - Discussed the possibility of having the flight path incorporate a line with dots at each direction change.
  - Got rid of the drone model due to it resulting in the web page running slowly.
- Things we would like to do/change this iteration:
  - Increase front end and back end testing coverage.
  - Reset button for camera reset
  - Click on flight path to show drone information.
