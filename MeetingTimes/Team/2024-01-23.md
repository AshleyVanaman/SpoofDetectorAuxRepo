### Minute Recorder
Michaela

### Topics Discussed
- We began to talk through our project progress.
- Prioritizing tasks:
  - Implementing Timestamp
  - Drone Model rather than dots
  - updating DataProcessorTest and DroneTest to factor in the time implementation
  - Integrating test server
  - Refactoring code for readability
- Did some refactoring of DataProcessor as a group, we declared the variables at the top of the code rather than having to re-declare within each method of the class. We did this not only for readability and refactoring, but also to help avoid the potential of errors in the future.
- As a group we peer programmed/researched for the timestamp application to find a solution for the data to show up in 2023 rather than 1970.
- We then broke off into working on our own tasks for the rest of the meeting
  
### Topics Clarified
- Don't refactor based on intelliJ recommended refactoring from the context button, while this may be helpful in some cases, this can cause the code to become longer and bulky and potentionally difficult to understand
