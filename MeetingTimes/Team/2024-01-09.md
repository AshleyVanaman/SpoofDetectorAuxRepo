### Things we need to Do
- Configuration files; add test data varaibles on what is normal, what is not. Compare it to the standard. Add a note of where things may need to be changed.
- Tests for what we already have, make them more comprehensive.
- Time functionality needs added to the code so the play button works.
- Drone models rather than dots.
- Refactoring javascript and java program.
